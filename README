Questions:
How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library? 
Real thread libraries have their own registers and stack. Our library's "threads" only has their own 
logical stack we malloc'ed, but shares the same register with the main process by context switching. 
Our implementation is in the user space while real threads are lower level in the kernel space.

Name two ways in which this LWP library API could be improved.
1. We can use fork to provide the threads their own registers while allowing them to process in parallel.
2. We can add interrupt signals to provide preemption.

Instructions:
Running "make" will compile the LWP library and numbersmain.
