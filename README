Max number of jobs is 100. Defined in job.h by MAXSIZE.

Questions:
1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
When all processes have the same burst time because they all have the same remaining time and will choose the first that arrived.

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
When all processes have the same burst time and RR's quantum length is less than or equal to the smallest burst time.

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
When jobs' length increases, so does the response time. Since the prior job is smaller in length, the next job has to wait for the job to complete.
Yes, we can make jobs increase in burst time as they arrive and calculate their response times.

4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
When RR's quantum length increases, so does the response time. This is because jobs will run for a longer time before moving onto the next job, so
the job's 1st burst is delayed by the quantum length.
worst-case response time = (N-1)*quantum
