Install:
1. Run 'make -f build464Lib.mk' in root directory.
2. Run 'make' to create all object files.

Running Server:
./server error_percent port_#

Running Client:
./rcopy from_filename to_filename window_size buffer_size error_percent server_ip port_#

Comments:
I send a flag = 0 if the server cannot open the file.
